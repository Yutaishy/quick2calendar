## In-App Deletion
Users can delete local integration data by:
1. Opening app settings (`Cmd + ,`)
2. Selecting `Google連携 > 接続解除`
3. Confirming disconnection

This action removes locally stored Google OAuth tokens and attempts token revocation.

## Google-Side Access Removal
Users can also remove app access directly in Google Account settings:
- https://myaccount.google.com/permissions

## Deletion Requests
For additional deletion requests, contact:
- `REPLACE_WITH_SUPPORT_EMAIL`

Include:
- Account email used for login
- Request type (`token revoke`, `local settings deletion`, etc.)
